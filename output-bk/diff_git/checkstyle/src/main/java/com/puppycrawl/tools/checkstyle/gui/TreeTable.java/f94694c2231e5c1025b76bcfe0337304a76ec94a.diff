          * <p>The behavior for this is debatable, and should really be offered
          * as a property. By returning false, all keyboard actions are
          * implemented in terms of the table. By returning true, the
          * tree would get a chance to do something with the keyboard
          * events. For the most part this is ok. But for certain keys,
          * such as left/right, the tree will expand/collapse where as
          * the table focus should really move to a different column. Page
          * up/down should also be implemented in terms of the table.
          * By returning false this also has the added benefit that clicking
          * outside of the bounds of the tree node, but still in the tree
          * column will select the row, whereas if this returned true
          * that wouldn't be the case.
          *
          * <p>By returning false we are also enforcing the policy that
          * the tree will never be editable (at least by a key sequence).
