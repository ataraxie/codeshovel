# ICSE Artifact Status

This file details the ICSE 2021 Artifact Track badges we are seeking with this work.

The effort we have made to satisfy both the **reusable** and **available** artifact badges enables researchers or practitioners to quickly try out CodeShovel, use it for their own studies, or extend CodeShovel in any way they see fit.


### CodeShovel _Reusable_ Artifact

We believe CodeShovel deserves the Reusable artifact because this repo supplies all of the source files needed to install run CodeShovel in 5 minutes or less. Additionally, CodeShovel runs as a public web service (which is deployed without modification from this repository) so the installation step can be skipped and the tool can be used with no installation at all.

### CodeShovel _Available_ Artifact

We believe CodeShovel deserves the available badge because all materials associated with the research project have been placed online. These include the source code, the oracle used in the paper, and the reusable CodeShovel implementation.
